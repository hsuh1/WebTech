	<h3>Social Entrepreneurship Events</h3>
	<a id="1"></a>
	<h4> Global Social Economy Forum (GSEF) 2016 </h4>
	<p> Global Social Economy Forum (GSEF) 2016 is, like how the name suggests, a global forum focused on discussion of social economy. However, it differs from other social economy events in that both public sector and private sector come together at this event to discuss ways to collaborate. Usually, the forums are independent from one another as either only the private sector participates or the public sector organizes a simple symposium instead of a forum. At GSEF, mayors of major cities such as Seoul, Montreal, Hong Kong, Quezon, and Barcelona, come to the forum to discuss the issue and ways to improve their social economy with social enterprises from the private sector. From the private sector, representatives from major social organizations and enterprises such as the ILO, OECD, and UNRISD participate as well. On a smaller scale, representatives from more practical social organizations such as Asia Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN) and Taproot Foundation participate as well. I am personally passionate for this event because I have been part of organizing this amazing event in the year 2014. It was a great experience getting to meet various representatives from major cities and organizations. The experience really changed my future goals. I originally wanted to pursue a career in operations, more specifically supply chain management. After experiencing GSEF, I would like to become a social entrepreneur or at least work at a social organization. I would love to be part of something that creates meaningful social values. After its second inaugural meeting, the GSEF officially launched as a bi-annual global event. The host city for the GSEF 2016 will be Montreal, Canada and the forum will be held from September 7-9th, 2016. Hence the map of Montreal beneath. </p>

	<h4>Skoll World Forum</h4>
	<p> Skoll World Forum is probably the best well known social economy forum and is the biggest of its kind. However, the Skoll Forum involves delegates from not only social economy sector but also extends to people involved in the financial and other related private sectors as well. It is strictly invitation only event; however, it is amazing how it retain 1,000 delegates to participate annually. However, people can still participate through its online platform that is open to the public, although they can't directly participate in the ongoing discussions.</p>
