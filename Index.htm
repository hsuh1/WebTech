	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p> <img src="Images/me.png" alt="empty" title= "a photo of myself" width="100"/></a> Honestly, I came to <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Babson College</a> because it was a great pivot point.
	Originally I wanted to study Hotel Management and the best school for Hotel Management is Cornell Univesirty. 
	However, my GPA wasn't good enough to go there. So I came to Babson College to study general business management.
	While here, I learned a lot about entrepreneurship and how it can be applied to any aspect of my life.
	Then I came across the idea of social entrepreneurship, which is a type of entrepreneurship that is focused on targetting social issues.
	Currently, I am planning to work for the Lewis Institute, a social innovation lab at Babson College, after graduation.
	Most likely, I will be working there for half a year to a full year; then I would like to move on to creating my own social enterprise.
	Or I would love to work for the <a href="http://www.ashoka.org/">Ashoka foundation</a>, a social organization founded by the CEO of Ebay. </p>

	<h2> My Hobbies</h2>
	<p> My favorite hobbies are <a href="http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/">League of Legends</a> and <a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Hearthstone</a>.
	League of Legends, more commonly known as the LOL, is a Real-time strategy (RTS) game with Role Playing Game (RPG) aspects.
	I enjoy this game because of two main reasons. First, it is a game that requires quick reaction and great intuition. Second is that I get to enjoy both the strategy and RPG aspects of a game.
	There is a reason why the e-Sports is booming nowadays.Computer games are not simply games that you sit around and simply play anymore.
	You need to strategize, be able to work as a team, and have quick reactions. I enjoy Hearthstone because it is a quick card game.
	However, it has great variety of interesting cards to keep me interested. I play this game more often than I do LOL nowadays, because I could simply enjoy Hearthstone for about 20 minutes.
	While a game of LOL usually take around 40-50 minutes. </p>
