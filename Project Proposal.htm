<h1> Project Proposal by Hee Won Suh </h1>
<h2> What is your website about? </h2>
<p>My website will be about social entrepreneurship. Although Babson College is famous for its entrepreneurship courses, its field of social entrepreneurship is still insignificant.
	Although Lewis Institute, its social innovation lab, has been around for a long time, many of the students do not even know what it is or what it does.
	Likewise, not many people are aware of what social entrepreneurship is in general. It has been only a recent event when the term social entrepreneurship is even recognized.
	I only came across the term and its field while I was taking a year long leave of absence 
	and worked at a <a href="http://sehub.net/">Seoul Social Economy Center</a> and helped them organize the <a href="http://gsef2014.org/">Global Social Economy Forum 2014</a>. </p>
<h2> What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important? </h2>
<p>The objective of my website will be to raise awareness of social entrepreneurship by introducing different types of social enterprises.
	It will also provide information about important events that are related to the topic such as the GSEF 2016. 
	It will also provide information about which resources are available for those who want to pursue social entrepreneurship.  </P>
<h2> Who is your target audience set? </h2>
<p>My target audience is anyone who is already interested or would be interested in social entrepreneurship. 
	It will be most helpful to those who are seeking understanding of what social entrepreneurship is and would like to explore what he could do to get involved.</P>
<h2> What content do you plan to include in each page of your website? </h2>
<p> Each page will be dedicated to a type of social enterprise and it will introduce social enterprises that are related to that category.
	For example, one page will be about Environmental Social Enterprises. </br> A social enterprise that will be under this category would be <a href="http://bigbelly.com/">BigBelly</a>.
